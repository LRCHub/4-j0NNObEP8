Going Black ‘Cause All The City Lights
Tired Of Being On The Run
I Feel The Cold Is Coming Through The Night
And We’re Longing For The Sun
‘Cause We Are Sick Of Trying To Make It Through
When Someone Else Is Over Us
So Stand Together And You’ll See It Too
Got No Choice We Gotta Trust
So Stand By Me
I'll Stand By You
Stand By Me
I'll Stand By You
I'll Stand By You
I'll Stand By You
I Try My Best To Keep Us Moving On
Hold My Head Above The Ground
'Cause Everyday They Try To Hold Us Down
But We’ve Only Just Begun
'Cause We Are Sick Of Trying To Make It Through
When Someone Else Is Over Us
So Stand Together And You’ll See It Too
Got No Choice We Gotta Trust
So Stand By Me
I'll Stand By You
I'll Stand By You
I'll Stand By You
If You’re Gonna Stand By Me
I Know I’ll Stand By You
